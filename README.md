  To create a budget, first you must create a account which will be the opening page as you enter the application. Users can also signout and back out to the login page at anytime by using the navbar logout link. After creating an account the user will be brought to the dashboard where they will be given the option to create a new budget and be rerouted to the build budget page. After creating an budget, users will see this newly created budget in their dashboard where they can click on and be taken to the create expense page. This page will allow the user to create expenses and see the remaining amount of their budget after tallying every expense.
